**Software Engineer @ Melina Aero - Feb 2017 to Mar 2018**

In a lead back-end engineer role on a micro startup environment with wide responsibilities, I was responsible for software architecture, lifecycle, quality assurance and DevOps in developing a product which does modeling, simulation and optimization of thermodynamic cycles.

During the time I work, I

  * helped the team to adopt unit testing, clean coding, developing respect to design patterns, Git VCS and GitHub Flow workflow
  * integrated continuous integration to our workflow using Jenkins and TeamCity including automated tests, code reviews and test coverages
  * elicited business requirements and designed and documented software architecture
  * managed migration of the existing codebase in Matlab to C# in order to have better tooling in .NET environment.
  * implemented application and data access layer
  * wrote unit, system and integration tests in xUnit and MSTest
  * administered and maintained hardware and software of our build server  


**Marmara Turkish Coreference Corpus and Coreference Resolution Baseline   
@ Marmara University - Sep 2015 to Jan 2017**

As my bachelor's thesis I co-authored [Marmara Turkish Coreference Corpus
and Coreference Resolution Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01863).

With the lead of my advisor [Peter Schüller](http://www.peterschueller.com/),

  * created an algorithm for Turkish mention detection and co-reference resolution
  * created [a command-line interface tool in Python3](https://github.com/ferittuncer/ITU-Turkish-NLP-Pipeline-Caller) to ease access to the [İTÜ NLP Pipeline](http://tools.nlp.itu.edu.tr/).


**Software Developer @ VakıfBank - Sep 2013 to Jan 2014**

I was responsible for integrating customers' payment processors via web services to the bank's payment processor written in .NET. During the time I work, my integrations for several betting companies such as Nesine.com, Misli.com, TJK.org, and several others deployed to production.

I took part in researching the economic and technical feasibility of using Microsoft BizTalk for building an enterprise service bus.


**Programmer @ Marmara University - Feb 2012 to Apr 2014**

I programmed and maintained a software tool in Java for benchmarking newly developed algorithm for the problem of scheduling on a single machine to minimize the maximum lateness when each job has a different ready time, processing time, and due date. This work is published as follows: [Calis, Banu, Serol Bulkan, and Ferit Tuncer. "A heuristic approach to minimizing maximum lateness on a single machine." South African Journal of Industrial Engineering 26.3 (2015): 41-53.](https://journals.co.za/content/indeng/26/3/EJC181212)
